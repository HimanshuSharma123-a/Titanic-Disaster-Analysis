# Titanic-Disaster-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring and cleaning the Titanic dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the machine learning and data science community. The goal of this project is to perform thorough data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation tasks to prepare the dataset for analysis or predictive modeling. The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including attributes such as their age, sex, class, and whether they survived or not. The primary objectives are to identify missing data, handle outliers, encode categorical variables, and summarize the cleaned dataset for analysis.
